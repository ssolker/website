      <h2>Job Description</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <p>During my 4-month work term I had the title of Programmer again and for the most part worked on their uExcavate software. As it was a small company and being a returning hire, they trusted me with a lot of development and design ideas. For the majority of my time there, I was the only employee working on their uExcavate software. The term started out as tending to bugs in uExcavate, but with the addition of new customers came a lot of new development and I got to experience working with the customer to provide them with software to suit their needs.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some aspects of the job included:
      </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <ul>
        <li>Modifying a parser to parse emails</li>
        <li>Web development/design</li>
        <li>Writing database queries</li>
        <li>Creating AWS lambda functions</li>
        <li>Working with API's</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <p>
      The transferable skills I needed during my work term were communication, time management, adaptability, decision making. I then also needed a lot of technical skills. I worked a lot with AWS, programmed in javascript, php, html, css and java. Most of what I needed to learn, I learnt on the job, but school definitely gave me a good base to work off of. School helped me know what to look for when designing usable software and creating good documentation like UML diagrams.

      <h2>Academic Relationship</h2>

      <p>
        My last coop at ComPeters I worked in mostly VB and Java, however this work term I also  programmed in Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS. Web development was not touched on much in school which is why I believe this work term definitely advanced my academic experience.<br><br>Not only did I get to work with programming languages I was unfamiliar with, I was given the opportunity to work with different programming services like AWS lambda and their Cloud 9 IDE. I also got to work with some third-party api’s, which is something I have never done in school and now believe I have a good grasp on how to use api’s in the future.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <p>
        With my second work term finished, I feel ever more confident that this is the field I want to pursue. As I may have mentioned before, school has helped me create a good base, however I feel like both my transferable and technical skills improve during my work terms.<br><br>While there are still many areas where I feel I need to improve on, the more experience I get, the more I understand what it means to be a good co-worker, employee and programmer.
