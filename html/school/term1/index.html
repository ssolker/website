      <h2>Job Description</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <p>During my 4-month work term I had the title of Programmer and mainly worked on Utilocate 2 and uExcavate. Since it is a small firm I was acting as a full-stack developer and having an influence on the whole development cycle while working in an agile development environment. I spent most of my time adding and testing new features as well as finding/fixing bugs in already existing software.<br><br> The most interesting part about the job is that I had the opportunity to learn and develop my own skills while seeing the impact of my work in the real world. A lot of what I was involved with was new to me so a lot of the skills I needed where learnt during the job. Excluding the basic and fundamental concepts which were learnt in school.

      <p>
      I found working here definitely enhanced my academic experience, it not only gave me opportunity to learn many new things but I could apply my knowledge I gained in school to my work there.
      <br><br> I worked in VB and Java mainly but also had opportunities to learn about new softwares, IDEs and languages. For example I delved a little bit into app development using Expo, which uses Javascript to develop cross-platform apps.
      <br><br> In school I also learned a little bit about databases and MySql but during this placement I saw and understood more clearly how a database could be used. How to make it efficient and organized as well as I improved my query writing.

      <p>
        With my first work term done and over with, I realized the importance of some concepts that were discussed about in school, but never really followed through with. Looking back, the projects in school are too small and time is short to see why you may do things a certain way or develop in a specific environment. This is just one of the many benefits from this work term, others include programming in multiple languages, working with new and different software and applications and being in a professional environment.
        <br><br>
        Being in a small firm I received insight on many areas and it is helping me figure out what I may want to do in the future. While providing me with some much needed experience in the real world, the work term also shed light on skills I need to work on if I want to be competent in my field and how I can better both my technical and transferable skills.
